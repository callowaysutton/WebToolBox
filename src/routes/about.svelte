<h1>About this website...</h1>

	<pre>
	This is a very simple website, all it does is store a ton of different conversion algorithms in one big JSON file and
then formats that into an editable document to help ease the need of having to search up different conversion
equations for your work.

The website is also very extendable. If there isn't a converter or equation here already, and you have the extra time
to spare, one could easily add their own converter as everything is just done in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. The only rules
that it has to follow is that it's completely client side and the fact that it has to be as compact as possible.
However, if you implement a quick and sloppy version, don't fret about it; I'd be happy to go in and optimize
your code to the best of my ability :D

Anyways, feel free to explore, download and use the website. You can also check out more of my websites such as the
<a href="https://ceo.sex">ceo.sex</a>, <a href="https://coolamazingwebsite.com">CoolAmazingWebsite</a>, or <a href="https://coolprivatenetwork.com">CoolPrivateNetwork</a>; and these are only a sliver of what I had on mind while
writing this site.

I have a around 7 more if you want to explore the web and try and find them all, there is a small easter egg on each
website which will help you find the next website, I wish you luck if you want to try and find them all :D

Anyhoo, I hope the services this site provides were to your suit and that you have a great day!
